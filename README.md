# Preface
We are a couple of individuals working in tech who have felt that something was
not quite right about our industry.

We struggle with reconciling who we are with tech's failure to meet the moment.
This is our attempt at providing a path forward that aims to empower
stakeholders, invest in positive outcomes, and realign incentives.

Our harm-reduction framework serves as a foundation of principles to guide
policy. We also offer a policy proposal as an example of how the harm-reduction
framework can be applied and implemented.

# Contributing
At the moment, there are no contributor guidelines.

We will work towards improving the framework and policy proposal, and hope that
you can give us a hand in this.

Search for discussion threads, issues, and pull requests. If no relevant results
pop up, feel free to contribute! Refinement and suggestions are welcome.

We are definitely receptive to ideas on how to incentive models relating to ads,
engagement, (meta)data reselling, and walled-gardens. We acknowledge those are
different kinds of “ducks” with similar negative outcomes and need to be skinned
differently.
