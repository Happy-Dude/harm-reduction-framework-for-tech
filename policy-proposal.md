The following proposal applies the harm-reduction framework as described above
and offers an actionable implementation for a technology services company. We
hope that the core idea is clear and can be adapted for any
provider-user-stakeholder relationship to empower stakeholders, invest in
positive outcomes, and realign incentives.

# Summary
A policy that provides employees a mechanism to redirect revenue from customers
participating in harmful behaviors to organizations dedicated to participating
in beneficial behaviors.

# Procedure
* Create and maintain an internal list of customers, visible to employees, that
they find objectionable and/or have been flagged for abuse.
    * Including the number of abuse reports and type of abuse.
    * Allow employees to anonymously add customers who they believe to be
    participating in harmful behaviors with little friction.
* Employees review the list to select and flag customers that they agree are
engaging in harmful behavior.
    * These selections are made with the awareness that by flagging a harmful
    customer, a portion of their revenue will be distributed elsewhere.
    * Employees can select multiple customers.
* The harmful customer's revenue collected by the company is proportionally
directed into a charity pool.
    * This proportional amount is based on the percentage of employees who have
    flagged them.
    * e.g.  ProviderCorp collects \$10,000 in revenue from CustomerA. This
    company has 1000 employees, and 600 of them selected to have the funds from
    CustomerA redirected to a charity pool.
        * 600/1000 of the revenue collected from CustomerA, or \$6,000, is
        funneled to a charity pool.
* Employees then proceed to identify a single charity for which to allocate
funds.
    * Employees select a single charity.
    * e.g. ProviderCorp has an accumulated charity pool of \$100,000. Each
    employee chooses one charity from the list. At the end of the quarter, 300
    employees selected the ACLU, 200 for BCRF, and 100 for EFF.
        * Because only a portion (600) of ProviderCorps employee base
        participated in the charity selection, the fund will be distributed
        based on the ratio of those who participated.
        * At the end of the quarter, the company distributes 300/600 of the
        charity fund to ACLU, 200/600 to BCRF, and 100/600 to EFF.
            * \$50,000.00 is donated to ACLU
            * \$33,333.33 is donated to BCRF
            * \$16,666.67 is donated to EFF
* A report summarizing the abuse complaints, employee sentiments, and
redistributed funds is published publicly at the end of the quarter for
promoting transparency and creating a healthier industry.
* This process is performed regularly.
    * Metrics are used to provide insights on fund reallocation and employee
    sentiment and made available for viewing and analysis.

# Rationale

## Empowering Stakeholders
The overarching theme of this policy proposal is to provide reciprocity between
providers and their employee stakeholders while maintaining the principles
outlined in the framework.

As it exists today, employee stakeholders generally have little to no voice or
input in selecting the users that are contracted to their provider or their
providers' charitable giving recipients. Neither of these are in perfect
alignment with employee stakeholder desires.

This proposal offers a better way of aligning desires with actions by
incorporating employee stakeholders' sentiment in their provider's charitable
giving initiatives via monetary redistribution.

## Accountability
By providing employee stakeholders visibility into users' harmful behavior and
publishing reports on a regular basis, providers promote transparency.

This allows employee stakeholders to understand the scope and scale of
unmitigated harmful user behavior by their provider.

This transparency also allows employee stakeholders to better hold the provider
accountable for its users and provide valuable insights that should inform
future policies and initiatives.

## Redirecting Resources
There is no perfect way to quantify the value of negative or positive outcomes
due to user or provider actions.

However, monetary redistribution gives employee stakeholders the capacity to
mitigate perceived negative outcomes by channeling resources into a positive
outlet.

## Aligning Incentives
Monetary redistribution along with increased transparency and accountability
create a lasting impact by realigning provider incentives with employee
stakeholder values.

It motivates employee stakeholders and providers to pursue customers who do not
engage in harmful behavior. This also incentivizes exploring monetization
mechanisms that are better aligned with employee values.

Overall, these shifts in incentives facilitate healthier relationships between
providers, employee stakeholders, users, and even external parties.
