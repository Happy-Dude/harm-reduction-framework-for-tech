The following harm-reduction framework was inspired by the research article,
[Harm reduction principles for healthcare
settings](https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-017-0196-4)
and it's accompanying
[figures](https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-017-0196-4/tables/1).
We adapted and applied this framework to a tech-industry context as best as
possible.
